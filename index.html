                    My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like
                    every

                    I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known for

                    several

                    Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company
                    Plan B
                    Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and
                    skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least two of these
                    interests—sometimes all three!
